Each of the cases has been corrected for errors and in some, there are mutiple versions to reflect differing (reasonable) judgments about the "true" values.  

**NOTE**: In the zip file for the cases, there is a word doc "missing data decisions" -- this covers many of the changes made to correct for errors / missingness (but not all).  For any given cases, we tried to triangulate the correct values by using CHES, Benoit / Laver, parlgov, wikipedia, and press coverage of the election / government coalition.
